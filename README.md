This code is the work of Jeremy H. Griffith, the founder of Omni Systems, who passed away in 2014. 

Compiled versions of Mif2Go, DITA2Go, and uDoc2Go are available for download from www.omsys.com.

As Jeremy wished, this code has been made available to the open source community for further refinement
and development.
