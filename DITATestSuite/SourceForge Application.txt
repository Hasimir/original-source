There are no "similar, existing solutions".  I brought this up 
on the [dita-users] list, and Don Day, the Father of DITA, 
agreed it was a good idea.  This project will provide a place 
for cummunity involvement and discussion of issues in the 
presentation of DITA.  It will use the current SourceForge 
DITA-OT as the reference implementation for this purpose, but 
is not a part of the DITA-OT itself.

Hi Jeremy,

Please provide more specific details about this proposal.

Cheers!,

Hi, Daniel.  You asked for further details.  What do you want 
to know???

I can send you a bunch of posts from the list about it; I can 
answer questions; but I'm at a bit of a loss as to what to say 
about a test suite... it kinda speaks for itself.  Do you know 
DITA?  If not, it will be hard to explain.  And if you do, Don 
Day's approval of the idea should have been sufficient...

The DITA-OT, which is hosted here already, is currently about 
the only way there is to produce usable outputs from DITA files.  
Several commercial vendors embed it in their products.  However, 
it is slow, and if you do not know XSLT, you will not be able 
to do anything to make even the simplest change, like putting 
a logo on the cover of your manual.  So several vendors are in 
process of coming up with alternative processors.  It will be 
very hard for users to tell who can do what, as compared to the 
reference implementation, the DITA-OT, unless there is a set of 
conformance test documents available.  This is intended to be 
that set.

An additional issue is that there is no vendor-neutral way to 
specify the result you want from processing your DITA files.  
So we intend to develop some, much like Norm Walsh has done 
for DocBook.  These will be PIs (still with me?) to specify 
things like page breaks that are by design not pert of the 
DITA spec, but that are essential to get decent output.  We 
will be using the test suite both to document these and to 
demonstrate them, as well as show vendor conformance (or not) 
with them.

If you have more questions, could you please give me an email 
address I can reply to?  I'm disabled, and typing in this box 
is painful.  Thanks.

Jeremy,

I'm trying to learn about the open source development that is 
proposed be done via this proposal.

I asked as this was tagged as "A project developing content 
(not software)". If this is indeed content, please detail that. 
We generally do not approve content only projects.

If that is tagged incorrectly, please go back in the process 
and change that to be reflective of the sort of project this 
is expected to be.

Thank you,

Starting over.  Since you have now explained that you never 
approve "content" projects, I've retagged it as documentation, 
which is also accurate.  (Why do you offer a choice that you 
never approve, anyway?  Wastes everyone's time.)

This project is intended to DEVELOP and DOCUMENT a set of 
Processing Instructions to be used in DITA topic and map 
files so that users can specify presentational choices in 
their documents.  These PI's are then used in the DITA-OT, 
hosted here on SourceForge for many years, to control details 
of DITA-OT software operation.  We expect that other software 
that does this job (DITA conversion for output) will also use 
the same PIs. thereby fostering interoperability across toolsets 
for DITA users.

Currently, the only way users can alter even simple presentational 
details, like page breaks, is by editing XSLT or Java code in 
the DITA-OT, recompiling (for Java), and testing.  That is, all 
users must become programmers.  As DITA spreads beyond its initial 
POC stage, this is a barrier to adoption.  So it *will* be solved 
by tool vendors; the intent of this project is to see it solved 
in a consistent way that does not lock users in to a particular 
vendor (because a change of tool would require thousands of 
changes in their files).

An additional goal is that the files DEVELOPED to DOCUMENT usage 
of the PIs will also serve as a test suite for the DITA-OT, a 
SOURCEFORGE PROJECT.  They can be used to help developers of the 
DITA-OT find their new bugs, and to help users evaluate alternate 
tools and methods of encoding their preferences for presentation 
of the DITA data.

Testing is an integral part of the software DEVELOPMENT process.  
It is a part sometimes neglected in Open Source projects, so we 
are attempting to remedy that for the DITA-OT and any other 
DITA-related projects on SourceForge, like the DITA Open Platform 
and about eight more.  All of them will benefit from using the 
Test Suite to verify their coverage of the DITA specs.

HTH!

Jeremy,

It does help. Let me first note that on we do approve some 
projects that seek to create documentation and/or content on 
occasion. Such cases are usually ones that include substantial 
code examples, etc.

In cases like this one, we encourage users to seek out the 
projects they are looking to help and add that effort to the 
existing project. This will further help that project by adding 
more value from which users of that software will benefit. This 
has the added value of making said project more robust.

If you will be including code, please detail that information 
so that we can further assess this proposal. However, I recommend 
that you contact the DITA-OT 
(https://sourceforge.net/projects/dita-ot/) project and offer 
your work to their project directly.

Best regards,
