
Conditonal text, "infotype", display issues in Frame and HTML
-------------------------------------------------------------

Conditions:
P1  Product1
P2  Product2
L1  French
L2  English

Info:
A  <P1><P2>all products</P2>
B  product 1, common to both langs 
C  <L1>en francais
D  <L2> and </L1>
E  in English</L2></P1>
F  <P2>product 2, common to both langs 
G  <L1>en francais
H  <L2> and </L1>
I  in English</L2></P2>

You want to show P1 and L1, but not P2 or L2.

In Frame, "show" is OR'd, so you get A, B, C (all fine)
and D, G, and H (since L1 is included).

In HTML, "hide" is OR'd, so you get B and C (as you want),
but not A (since P2 is excluded).

Note that D and H, marked for both L1 and L2, are only wanted when
both are selected, but that A is wanted when either P1 or P2 is shown.
These requirements are contradictory.  In this example, you could avoid
the problem with A in HTML by making it unconditional, but that fails
as soon as you have to add Product3 which doesn't want it...

One way of solving this is to ban overlapping conditions, and create
new conditions for each combination of basic conditions.  That's fine
here, and is the usual Frame workaround, but it fails when many more
basic conditions are added because of the resulting combinatorial
explosion.  My previous concept for a condition manager plugin was
to take this approach, but provide GUI tools that allowed the user
to work solely with the basic conditions.  The marker text would be
a base64 (or maybe just base16, hex) number where each bit indicated 
an applied condition.  The plugin would tell Frame which to show and 
hide.

On the UI side, the problem is how to express the specific combo
of conditions wanted.  You can have a list to Show (like Frame)
and a list to Hide (like HTML), but what do you do when an item
has conditions that appear on both lists (A, D, G, and H above)?
How do you specify what you want for that case?  Allow creation
of Boolean expressions to put on the list, like putting "P1&P2"
in the list to Show, and "L1&L2" in the list to Hide?

And do you let the user choose between "show all not hidden" (HTML) 
and "hide all not shown" (Frame)?
