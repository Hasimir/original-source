The JavaScript part of OmniHelp consists of code used in the main
bookname.htm file which creates the framesets, and in the ctrl.htm
and nav.htm files that are loaded into the top and left panes.  The
topic files themselves should not contain any OH code, just the code
they need for their own internal purposes, if any.


Frameset
--------

The Frameset defines the sizes and colors for all three panes,
and handles initial loading into them.  It accepts a parameter
of the name of the first Topic file to display, and a switch
for the initial content of the Nav pane.  In case of noframes,
it does what it can to add limited navigation facilities.

The syntax for the invocation is:

  oh [-n contents] bookname.htm[#topicfile.htm[#anchorname]]

where []s enclose optional elements as usual.

  </noframes>
 </frameset>
</html>


Control Pane
------------

The Control pane has, left to right, the following elements:

+ Widgets to select the type of navaid to appear in the Nav pane.
These may be pushbuttons, radio buttons, tabs, or a droplist.

+ A pushbotton toggle to show/hide the Nav pane altogether.

+ Back and Forward buttons to navigate through the history.

+ Prev and Next buttons to navigate through the browse sequence.

+ A Print/Send button that brings up a dialog.

+ Any other user-defined buttons, which can go anywhere in the
sequence of widgets after the Nav show/hide button.  An example
might be an Information Types selector widget.


Nav Pane
--------

The Nav pane initially loads the TOC data.  It loads the IX, Search,
and Glossary data only when they are requested from the Control pane,
using the widgets on the left.  The first load of each dataset may
take several seconds as the source XML is processed, but after that
any redisplay should be very fast.
